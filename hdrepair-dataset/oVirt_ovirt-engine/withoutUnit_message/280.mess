core: EJBUtilsStratehy - fix NPE in error log

In the findBean method, jndiNameSB is initialized inside the try block,
but referenced in the catch block.
If an exception was thrown before it was initialized, calling its
toString() will cause a NullPointerException.

This patch replaces the call of append(jndiNameSB.toString()) with
append(jndiNameSB), which is null-safe.
