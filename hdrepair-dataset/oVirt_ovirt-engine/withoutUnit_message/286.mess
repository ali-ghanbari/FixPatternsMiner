webadmin: fix message in importing VM dialog

This patch modify the message presented in the dialog that is being
shown when importing VM, such that it won't say that the import
status is shown in the events tab of the specific destination storage
domain, as it's not true and it's not trivial to implement because
there can be multiple destination storage domains (can be different
for each disk)
