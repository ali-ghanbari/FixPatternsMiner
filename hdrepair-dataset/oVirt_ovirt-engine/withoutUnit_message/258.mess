core: Fix VDS.hashCode()

VDS.hashCode() includes the hashCode() of vdsDynamic and vdsStatistics,
which are not present in VDS.eqauls(Object).

This behavior violates Java's contract that clearly states that if
a.equals(b) then it is required that a.hashCode() == b.hashCode().

This patch fixes the aforementioned bug by removing these two members
for the hashCode() calculation.
