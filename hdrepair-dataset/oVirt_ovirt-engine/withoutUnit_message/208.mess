gluster: set brick status as volume status

In gluster sync job, after volume information are synced, brick status
of new volumes are set to down state.  Whereas brick statuses are
synced by another thread which updates later.  This gives unpleasant
user experience.

This is fixed by setting brick status as volume status for new
volumes.
