webadmin: Events subtab of Users show nothing

The Events subtab list no records for a user even there are some
records. The problem is that UserEventListModel searches for users
with username=getEntity().getname() which refers to the first
 name of the user.

This fix changes it to getEntity().getusername() which refers to the
user name.
