core: temporary fix for vm deserialization

The introduction of graphics-info to VM broke the deserialization of VMs
using json since there is a 'getter' named 'getGraphicsInfos' without a
corresponding setter. This patch makes a temporary change in order to
overcome this problem by adding JsonIgnore annotation on the
getGraphicsInfos method, until a proper solution will be made.
