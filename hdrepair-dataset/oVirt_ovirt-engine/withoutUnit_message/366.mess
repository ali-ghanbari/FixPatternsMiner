core: allow snapshots for imported templates

when importing template, the AllowSnapshot is not initialized,
so by default its false, making all the disks not allowed to have snapshots.
this value is copied to the vms and is problematic.

when importing template, it is safe to assume that the AllowSnapshot is true for the disks,
as we only export disks that AllowSnapshot is true.
(this already happens for vms, this patch fix this for templates)
