core: make VmBase.isoPath default to empty string

making the VmBase property isoPath to an empty string is defensive coding
against creation of null values when building an XmlRpcStruct which will result exceptions
and not being able to run actions against VDSM.

while the fix is small, the real solution is to get rid of isoPath since
we have cd information kept in vm_devices already.
