core: fix ReconstructMasterDomainCommand constructor

In change:

 8255f44 aaa: more fixes to command context propgation

a new constructor has been added modifying the existing one to call the
base class (super).

Instead to maintain the previous behavior the old constructor should
have called the new one (in order to initialize the class).
