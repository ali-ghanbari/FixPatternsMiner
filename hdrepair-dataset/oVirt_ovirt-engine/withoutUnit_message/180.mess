core: fix NPE when migration caused by maintenance fails

On failure to migrate VM from VDS which is going to maintenance, we got
NPE in ExecutionHandler while trying to end the job.

The solution is to pass the job from the MaintenanceVds command to the
InternalMigrateVm command it invokes as well.
