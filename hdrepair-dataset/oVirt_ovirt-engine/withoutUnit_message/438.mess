webadmin: in dev mode create new host fails (#753180)

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/753180

This patch fixes the problem that in dev mode the first time the host
is added it fails on ClassNotFoundException.

From HostnameOrIp annotation the
@Constraint(validatedBy = HostnameOrIPConstraint.class)
has been removed in the gwt-extension project.
