webadmin: buttons are grayed out when vm is selected

This is a problem which came with the fix of the bug: No paging is
available through web-admin (#745000). The problem is that
SearchableListModel.setItems() called the ItemsChanged which
causes the problem.

This fix changes it to call only the UpdatePagingAvailability()
which is less invasive.
