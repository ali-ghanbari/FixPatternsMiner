core: fixed exception during creation of VM from template

During executing AddVmFromTemplateCommand, the parent parameters weren't
set on CloneVmFromVmTemplateCommand paramaters which is being executed
within. CommandBase throws an exception when the parent parameters aren't set which cause the template to remain in image locked status.
