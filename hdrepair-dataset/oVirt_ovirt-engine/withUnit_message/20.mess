core: Re-fix DAO tests

The previous fix to the DAO tests
(I627a3e291546b6a3c3d544c6f1914950f26298e0) wrongfully assumed that
Shared Disk feature was already MERGED, and thus creates a subtly
illegal database (multiple VMs connected to the same disk), which caused
test to fail randomly.

This patch reverts most of those changes, and introduces a stable
version of fixtures.xml and the tests based on it.
