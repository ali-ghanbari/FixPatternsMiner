fixes JOO-64
In static code, instance members incorrectly hide static identifiers
http://jangaroo.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/JOO-64

If an identifier is found in non-static scope, simply continue in
parent scope instead of throwing an error immediately.
However, the error message was not so bad, so if we could
restore this error message when it is actually justified...
