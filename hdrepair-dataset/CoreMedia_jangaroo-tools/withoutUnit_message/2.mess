fixes JOO-45
NPE when the default namespace is not specified in EXML
http://jangaroo.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/JOO-45

The error message is now "namespace 'null' of element '...' in EXML file
does not denote a config package", which is not optimal, but better
than a NPE and should suffice for such a rather rare case.
