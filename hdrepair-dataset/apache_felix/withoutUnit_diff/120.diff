+// TODO: FRAMEWORK - There is some indication that there is a memory leak
+//                   if we do not null the BundleInfo here. We should verify
+//                   that this is true, because if we null here then we have
+//                   check for nulls when we are releasing bundle locks, which
+//                   maybe cascading unnecessary ugliness. For now, I will
+//                   leave this commented out until we can investigate further.
