Issue #13 fix

This fixes #13. The issue was that the NumberField’s contents were
initialized to displayValue.toString() instead of
displayValue.getValue.toString(). For whatever reason, only one of the
values wasn’t changing before the user saw the field, making this bug
slightly more mysterious than it really was.
