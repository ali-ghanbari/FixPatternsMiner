resolve: https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2305 - think the correct fix is to have the masterBroker stop but not propagate the stop through the filter chain. if it does not stop then it will have a bunch of failures on sync with the slave. the issues is visible when a plugin is the next brokerfilter in the chain
