Delay rendering into Surface until draw completed.

Hold off on updating surface with animation until the Surface draw has
completed. Previously we were calling Surface.setAlpha/setLayer/
setMatrix prior to the app drawing into the surface. This fixes a bug
that caused a flash of the target animation image before the animation
had begun.
