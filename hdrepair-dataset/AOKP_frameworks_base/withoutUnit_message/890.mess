Check for BT state when sending Bond State Change intent.

When users use application specific Bluetooth state changes,
and the bond state changes, we crash.

We need to recheck Bluetooth state in all functions and scenarios
and even maintain a per application pid Bluetooth state, but this fix
is quick fix for a problem.
