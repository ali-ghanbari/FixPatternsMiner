Change default TIME_DELAYED_TO_RESTART_RADIO to 60secs from 20secs.

This is the simple fix for bug 2199271 which increases the timeout
for DEACTIVATE thus allowing more time to complete before SETUP_DATA_CALL
is retried. This should fix some occurrences of this bug as the current
time is known to be too short.
