Force redraw of new/resized windows

Our use of the GL flag EGL_SWAP_BEHAVIOR_PRESERVED_BIT caused a problem
with windows that are resized, where some of the contents were not being
updated when the window was first placed/resized. The fix is to force the
window to redraw completely when it is first resized.
