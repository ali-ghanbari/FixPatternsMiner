OutputRegistry did not return the default output in the set of available outputs

this lead to the BatchedESOutputFlusher to not flush any buffers at all
the buffer was only being flushed whenever it reached the maximum configured size, seemingly losing messages (even though they were still there)

in low traffic environments this could lead to confusion

fixes #635
