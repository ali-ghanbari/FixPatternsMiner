393051 Increment bundle version for change in dev branch

- The version of org.eclipse.equinox.p2.publisher.eclipse has not been
  incremented in the Kepler branch yet. The last change
  included a fix, so according to
  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering, the service segment needs
  to be increased to the next hundred.
- Also: Update year in copyright headers of touched files.
