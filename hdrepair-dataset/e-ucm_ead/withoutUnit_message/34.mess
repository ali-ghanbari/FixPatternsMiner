Merge pull request #289 from jtorrente/fix-nonstandardjson-bloodynathan

Fixing a problem with bad formed json, after recent changes in libgdx
- After adding support for C-style comments in their JSON parser, all '/' in string values *must* be properly quoted
- Fixed a bug when saving polygons generated by tracing borders: JSON serializer chokes on Arrays.asList, and requires such lists to be copied over to ArrayLists instead.
