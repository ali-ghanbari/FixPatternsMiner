Disable HBase short CF names

I think this feature suffered a regression.  It seems to work in
diskstorage tests, but something in graphdb is trying to use a
short-form name instead of a long-form name, triggering:

Caused by: com.thinkaurelius.titan.diskstorage.PermanentStorageException: Must use CF long-form name "titan_ids" instead of the short-form name "i" when configured with short-cf-names=true

in many of the HBase unit tests.  Disabled until I can come back to
this and fix it.
