QPID-4352: fix break in ConnectionFactory following SSL truststore/keystore password masking in URL toString().

Makes SSLTest use a ConnectionFactory instead of instantiating AMQConnections directly, exposing this issue.
Replaces horrible use of an AMQConnectionURL objects in MultipleBrokersFailoverTest and FailoverBehaviourTest (which both broke after this fix) with fully string-generated connection strings.
