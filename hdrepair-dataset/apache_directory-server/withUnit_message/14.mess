Re-committing 560042: "Fixed DIRSERVER-895, where a server will never accept replication logs until it is restarted if a connection is closed during a replication transaction (e.g. due to a message timeout).  No test for this yet as other issues would prevent it from being reliable."  Hopefully the fix for DIRSERVER-998 will have made the test stable.
