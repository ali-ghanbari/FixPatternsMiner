 o added test case for subentry service testing
 o created and ran test cases for entry and subentry addition functionality
 o some tests found bugs in the subentry service code which we fixed immediately

More test cases will follow to exand the coverage on this service.  This is 
being done so we can rapidly refactor the service to reduce its size and 
complexity.
