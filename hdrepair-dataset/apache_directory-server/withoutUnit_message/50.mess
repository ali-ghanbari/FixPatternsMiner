o fixed an issue with updating entry sent to a consumer in refreshNPersist mode
  (when such a consumer can't be reachable for some reason and a MODIFY event happens on provider's DIT during that time
   then that will be sent to the client as a ADD event when the consumer comes back and resumes the session again)
