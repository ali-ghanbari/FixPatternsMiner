fixing http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSERVER-657 which was due to
improperly named DefaultAuthorizationService name in server.xml files.  Also 
looks like maven shifted under our feet again and is requiring an actual 
classes directory under target.  Added a dummy java file to work around this.
