somehow some people are getting situations where the payload doesnt decompress.  wtf?
do i need to wrap the Input/Output streams we use to pipe data over the net with a verification wrapper for the messages?
e.g. prefix the serialization of all I2NPMessages sent on the wire with the SHA256 of that serialization and verify on read?
Ho hum, dunno.  maybe its something else, but the ElG/AES+SessionTag already has integrity verification so the only thing I can
think of is a checksum error that got past TCP's checking and corrupted the AES stream.
