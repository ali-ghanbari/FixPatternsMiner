    * Merge in dr|z3d and my own html fixes for router console java and jsp
      files so that Opera (and now IE?) doesn't puke anymore on the missing
      and misplaced HTML tags.
    * Optimized all jsp files so that they are shorter to save space, which
      is then used to fix the broken HTML. We should break even space-wise.
    * Bump to -13.
