+# Kuali Coeus Data Conversion
+
+This module handles complex data migrations.  These migrations may span multiple schemas or contain complex business logic.
+The migrations represent a modification to KC data that is required at a certain point in time in the KC project.  Just
+like normal SQL migration scripts, these migration programs only need to be executed once and must be execute at the
+correct time.  These migrations can be run in dry run mode and when dry run is turned off will never commit when
+encountering an error.
+
+This program is designed to run as a standalone java application or to be integrated into a data loading process.  The
+easiest way to figure how to execute this program is to run it without any arguments.  In this case, it will print out
+the various options and targets.  The general idea behind this program is to do the following:
+
+1. Place the database driver on the classpath.
+2. Setup the commandline arguments to point to the kc and rice schemas.  In bundled mode this will be the same.
+3. Pick any options desired such as logging level or dry run
+4. Pick one of more targets
+5. Execute
+
+Note that all of the steps other than the first step happen at once on the command line.
+
+## Supported Targets
+
+Proposal (proposal)
+
+This migration reads KIM information related to proposal role membership at the document-level.  These document-level
+memberships are managed from the document access panel through the user interface.  The document-level membership
+is removed from our existing unit based roles and moved to newly created document-level derived roles.  The membership
+data will eventually be placed into the document_access table.
+
+To look at the placement of this migration within a migration sequence see V600_085__ProposalRoleConversion in the
+coeus-db-sql module.
+
+
+Proposal Person Role (pprole)
+
+This migration reads rice database parameter information related to the configuration of Proposal Person role
+data.  This parameter information is eventually moved to a proposal person role table.  The parameters are then deleted
+from the system as they are no longer used.  The target table for this migration is eps_prop_person_role.
+
+To look at the placement of this migration within a migration sequence see V600_084__PropAwardPersonRoleConversion in the
+coeus-db-sql module.
