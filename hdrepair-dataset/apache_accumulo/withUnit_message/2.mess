ACCUMULO-3461 Fix race condition in ZooTraceClientTest

The 2nd call to ZooTraceClient.updateHostsFromKeeper is made
asynchronously (after waiting for 0ms). This will sometimes
pass and sometimes fail. Add a delegate to the 2nd call and
make a simple latch that the test case can wait on to ensure
both calls happened before we verify the mock's state.

Also fixed a bad log message that [~ecn] noticed.
