Minor haproxy health monitor cleanup and fixes

* changes default config for l4lb docs to use a trailing back slash
* moves the ensurenamespace call into a try block
* moves some calls happening in a namespace to be called outside a namespace.
  These calls did not need a namespace as we are only using network namespaces
  not process namespaces.
