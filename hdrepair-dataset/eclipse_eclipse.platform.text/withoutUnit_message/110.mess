ICompletionProposalExtension3:
- removed updateReplacementOffset
- removed updateReplacementLength

These were used for updating proposals in linked mode (parameter and template proposals).
Replaced by using proposals that track their replacement region themselves (see PositionBasedCompletionProposal)

- removed getReplacementString (previously used by TemplateProposal)

- renamed getCompletionText -> getPrefixCompletionText
- renamed getCompletionOffset -> getPrefixCompletionStart
