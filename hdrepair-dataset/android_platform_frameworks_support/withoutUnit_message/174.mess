Fix List Menu Text Colour

This commit fixes a few things around the text
colour on the list menu:

- Combats against <v9 and v9-10 different panel
   backgrounds. We now use TextAppearance.Widget.IconMenu.Item
   as the base theme and increase text size.
- Fix Sub Menu text colour by using primary_text_light
   instead of attr text colours (as the bg is always light
   <v11).
