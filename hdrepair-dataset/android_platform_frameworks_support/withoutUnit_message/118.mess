fix default background is lost when transition back.

Both Browse and Detail activity shared the same theme
drawable.  When pops Detail activity,  transition fades out
window background of Detail activity which sets alpha to 0
on theme drawable.

Fix is to having each window manager maintain a different
drawable state for theme drawable.
