bug 7249: during volume creation (root and data) for a vm, there was no state being set (we need to set it to ready). Hence, whilst re-attaching a detached vol, we hit a NPE. Fixed the root cause of the state not being set during vm creation, and consequently, fixed this npe
status 7249: resolved fixed
