CLOUDSTACK-3441: [Load Test] High delays between VM being allocated to Pod and network implementation causing delays in VM deployment
This is a regresion caused due to fix for CLOUDSTACK-70. In order to fix network restart scenario, delays got introduced in the user VM deployment scenario.
Fixed it by separating out the network restart and new VM deployment scenario such that the latter is not affected due to the fix for CLOUDSTACK-70.
