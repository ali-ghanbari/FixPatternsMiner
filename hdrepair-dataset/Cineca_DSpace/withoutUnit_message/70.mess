Resolving METS validation bug, located by Robin Taylor.   The METS @ID attribute does not allow a colon (:) in its value.  Previously, I had mistakenly added "hdl:" as part of the @ID attribute value during one of my AIP-based commits.   This commit fixes that issue by removing the string "hdl:" from the @ID.  The @ID now has a format of "Dspace-[objectType]-[objectHandle]".
