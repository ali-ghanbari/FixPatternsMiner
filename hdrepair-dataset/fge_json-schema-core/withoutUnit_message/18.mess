AbstractProcessingReport: fix success status on report merging

It is possible that the report to merge with has no message but is considered a
failure: in this case, .dispatch() will not set the current log level correctly.

Set it by hand instead: if the other report is a failure, change the current
level if it was previously strictly lower than ERROR.
