Fix regression in static resource handling (TORQUE-812)

The fix for TORQUE-792 broke static resource handling for requests
where the StaticResourceServlet would have returned a 304
response. This modifies the previous fix to be very specific in only
passing HTTP OPTIONS requests through to the Rack layer in the case
when the response is not in error after passing through all other
filters in the chain.
