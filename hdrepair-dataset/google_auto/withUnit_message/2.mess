Convert an unchecked exception thrown by AutoValueProcessor into a compiler error. This leads to a less confusing experience for end users when a bug in AutoValueProcessor or javac leads to such an exception.

Also fix a couple of minor things in CompilationErrorsTest: imports in the wrong order, and a TODO that was in fact done long ago.
