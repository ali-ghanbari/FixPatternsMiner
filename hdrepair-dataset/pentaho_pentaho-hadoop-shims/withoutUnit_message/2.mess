PDI-13082 - Regression: MapReduce Input is missing Serializable Data Type

fix wrong reflection call.

...this will copy from value to result (java reflection call - when really we do want to have a copy from result to value) - that will lead to empty values passed down from mapper transformation.

see https://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/Result.html#copyFrom%28org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Result%29

Based on if/else if Result will implement Writable interface this issue will not occurs. So this is specific to cloudera CDH5 for example.

Java reflection can be very 'inversion of control' in some cases.
