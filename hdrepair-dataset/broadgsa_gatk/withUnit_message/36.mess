Final bugfix for CombineVariants

-- Now handles multiple records at a site, so that you don't see records like set=dbsnp-dbsnp-dbsnp when combining something with dbsnp
-- Proper handling of ids.  If you are merging files with multiple ids for the same record, the ids are merged into a comma separated list
