Added forum API version stub to base URL for posting GATKDocs

    This will prevent bugs from occurring when Vanilla make changes to the API
    as described here: http://vanillaforums.com/blog/api#configuration
    Based on the bug that broke the website Guide section on 9/6/12,
    the GATKDocs posting system will probably break in the next release if
    this is not applied as a bug fix.
