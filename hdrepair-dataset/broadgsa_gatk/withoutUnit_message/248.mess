Ignoring deletions in the primary pileup by default was causing the primary pileup to become shorter than the secondary pileup when building up the secondary base pileup string. This fix makes sure to include the primary Ds within the pileup so that not only are the pileups guaranteed to be the same size, the same offsets will truly correspond with the same read.
