Bug fix when running UG in GenotypeGivenAlleles mode: if an input site to genotype had no coverage, the output VCF had AC,AF and AN inherited from input VCF, which could have nothing to do with given BAM so numbers could be non-sensical. Now new vc has clear attributes instead of attributes inherited from input VCF.
