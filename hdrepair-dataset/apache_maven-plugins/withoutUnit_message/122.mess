PR: MNG-1379

Commented out the line in EclipsePlugin.java that reconfigures the artifact file based on dependency systemPath, and reran the tests...it seems to pass just fine, so I assume the problem has been fixed as a side effect of another issue's resolution. I'm leaving the code in there (but commenting out the method call), just in case this proves to be incorrect.
