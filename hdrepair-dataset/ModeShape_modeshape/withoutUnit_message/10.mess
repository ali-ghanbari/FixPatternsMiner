MODE-1257 Corrected class cast exception

The JoinRequestProcessor.process(RemovePropertyRequest) was incorrectly casting the forked request
to SetPropertyRequest. This was a copy-and-paste error, and fixing it appears to fix the issue.
(Additional tests being added under MODE-1256.)

All unit and integration tests pass with these changes.
