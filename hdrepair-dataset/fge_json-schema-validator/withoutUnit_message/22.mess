SchemaRegistry: fix stupid error in .get()

The element to put should use the supplied URI, not the downloaded container's
URI.

This also means there are still two bugs in there:

* you can use any URI as a key, but we should only allow absolute URIs;
* you can insert with a given URI while the container has another, which leads
  to a discrepancy.
