Improve performance when using many ValueProxies with RequestFactory.
Contributed by tbroyer.

"When checking whether entities were persisted by processed invocations in
createReturnOperations, SimpleRequestProcessor erroneously also ran the
check with value proxies. Unfortunately, whereas entity proxies are resolved
from the request 'cache', with value proxies a new proxy is created each
time, with its properties resolved (which includes referenced proxies!).
This results in a significant slow down."

Fixes issue 7231. (It's unclear whether it's a complete fix.)
