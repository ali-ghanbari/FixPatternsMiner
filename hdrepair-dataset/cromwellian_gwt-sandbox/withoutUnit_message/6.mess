Fix handling of null in AssertionFailedError(String).

Previously, you would see "junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: null"
if you pass in 'null' as the message for AssertionFailedError (which
many Assert methods do). This was fixed in the core JUnit code
in https://github.com/junit-team/junit/commit/1b809a4a2e
