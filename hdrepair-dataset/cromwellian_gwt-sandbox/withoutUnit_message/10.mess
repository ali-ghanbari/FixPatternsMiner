Fixes most issues with the SoyC reports (take 2).

Now the CodeSplitter2 (codeplitter with fragment merge) will produce a meaningful
soyc detailed report. The report does not take into account code movement due
to fixups.

The original patch (11dacc9) was garbled by a rebase that basically deleted the
line this one adds back.
