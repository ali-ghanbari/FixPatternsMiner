[ActivityManager] fix NPE in ActivityStack.resetTargetTaskIfNeededLocked.

Symptom:
in .ActivityStack.resetTargetTaskIfNeededLocked,  "allowTaskReparenting" if case will call setTask
to remove activities from task, that will caused numActivities in main for-loop not consist with task.mActivities size.
caused NPE will happend in finish activities for-loop due to get null object from activities when clearWhenTaskReset" as true case.

Root Cause:
when clearWhenTaskReset as true, will set "end" variable as numActivities -1, but if calling setTask to remove activities from task,
end value will out of date & not same with task.mActivities size.

Solution:
use activities.size() - 1 to assign end value.
