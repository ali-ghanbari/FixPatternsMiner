Add case-sensitive tests to DRT ignore list.

/mnt/sdcard forces lowercase, but these tests verify
the capitialization of the filename. We will never pass them
with DRT1 while storing tests on external storage. DRT2 will
fix this as it does not store any files locally (hence DRT2's
ignore list is unchanged).
