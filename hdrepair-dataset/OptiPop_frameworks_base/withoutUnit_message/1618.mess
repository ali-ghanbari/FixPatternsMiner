Fix the issue of new call failing in 3-way call scenario.

The issue this change fixes can be reproduced by:
1. place an MO call;
2. place the second MO call;
3. hangup from the other end for one of the calls so there is only
   one call connected;
4. try to place another call.
This issue is that the new call would fail.
