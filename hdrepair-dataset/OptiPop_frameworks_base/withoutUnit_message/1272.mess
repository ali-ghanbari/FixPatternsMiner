Adding default profiles for specific levels.

The low and high profiles should each match one of the
specific profiles. So we need to add the specific profiles
corresponding to the low/high profiles. This makes the
default profile compliant to documentation + cts.

Also fixed javadoc to account time lapse profiles.
