DefaultDatasetService: fix visibility problem

This problem was introduced with horrible hack
b255ae47caf3d42d85b56e5735df798f2350e239. An exception is thrown because
the modifier of the inner class is private rather than protected, and so
it cannot be instantiated via reflection. This change fixes the issue.
