AppUtils: fix base directory detection on Windows

The problem was that Windows uses backslashes instead of forward slashes
for its path. We now standardize to a common UI-independent file path to
avoid the issue.

(I wonder how many thousands or millions of hours have been lost in
cross-platform development due to bugs caused by this discrepancy...)
