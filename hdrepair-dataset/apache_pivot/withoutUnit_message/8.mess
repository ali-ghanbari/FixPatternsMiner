PIVOT-880: NPE when setting the root directory to a Windows UNC path
in a FileBrowserSheet.

Caused by the fact that the \\ doesn't match any items in the drive
list, and one of the listeners assumes the item will always be there.
Simple test for a non-null item fixes the issue and allows the UNC
path to be used, and to display items.
