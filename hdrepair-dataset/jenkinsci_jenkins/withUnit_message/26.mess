[FIXED HUDSON-4226] Applied the patch and added a test case. This fix will be in 1.325.
I also added subversion.hpi in the dependency of the test-harness so that we can use Subversion check out for tests. I was afraid of a circular dependency problem when building the subversion plugin, but apparently Maven handles it gracefully.
