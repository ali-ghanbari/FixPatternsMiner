Don't provision more slaves when some are coming online.
The needsSomeWhenNoneAtAll ought to take into account nodes which are coming online, especially when a cloud returns slaves which are not connected. This is fixed by adding the idleSnapshot, which takes connecting slaves into account (totalSnapshot does not).
