Fixed double overallocation bug

If WriteHandleImpl.commit fails, then overallocation would be adjusted
twice, thus breaking accounting.

A test case (actually extends an existing test case) was added to cover
this bug. WriteHandleImpl is fixed such that overallocation is only
resolved once.

I eliminated an unused parameter in RepositorySubsystemTest, which is
why several test cases have been touched.
