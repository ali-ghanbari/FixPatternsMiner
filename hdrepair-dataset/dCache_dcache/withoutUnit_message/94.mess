config: fix check-config for single files

A recent commit introduced the check-config command to verify a 
dCache configuration against the property annotations.  
Unfortunately, this patch missed assigning the LNR.  Without this, 
the filename and line-numbers are missing in the warning and error 
messages.

This patch adds the missing assignment.
