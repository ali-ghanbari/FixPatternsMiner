Pool: Restore Volatile Mode support

_lfsMode was set to Precious even if the option was asking it to be set to volatile. LQCD found out
this while testing 1.9.5-9 This patch fixes it.

NB. This patch is from Timur; however, for expediency, I'm committing it on his behalf as he
requested.

Patch is for 1.9.5 and Trunk
