cells: fix how bugs are reported from ac_ command.

When invoking an ac_ command, if an unexpected RuntimeException
is thrown then a CommandPanicException is thrown.  Unfortunately
the message and chained exception is the ITE rather than the
underlying RuntimeException.

This patch fixes this so that the underlying message is sent.
