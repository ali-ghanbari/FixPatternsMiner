ttools: fix serious multi-SSA protocol bug

SsaConeSearcher was failing to add the mandatory "REQUEST=queryData"
parameter to HTTP requests when making SSA queries.
So correct SSA services (e.g. DaCHS) would reject the request,
though some lenient ones might allow it.
I think this bug has been present in the topcat and stilts multi-SSA
clients (though not the topcat single SSA query window) for ever :-(.
