ttools: fix PlotDisplay graphics positioning

Change the component offsets for drawing the graphics in
PlotDisplay.paintComponent.  I don't really understand exactly where
in the Swing API the component location is applied, but by trial and
error doing it like this works, and doing it like it was done before
painted the graphics in the wrong place if getLocation() was not (0,0).
