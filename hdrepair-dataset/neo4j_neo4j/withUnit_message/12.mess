Fixes issue with Monitor tags

TaggedMonitorListenerInvocationHandler was not getting the tags that
 it was created with. The result was that listeners added for specific tags
 would get called for all invocations of the observed interface regardless.
 This commit fixes the issue and adds a test for it.
