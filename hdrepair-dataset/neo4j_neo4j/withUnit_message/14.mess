Fixes Paxos instance reuse issue

It is possible for a Paxos instance to be started before a previous
 instance has been closed, and to use the same instance Id. A potential
 bug around this is that on receiving phase1Timeout for the second
 instance, the message will be dropped altogether and not retried, as
 the proposer state machine considers the instance closed.
 This commit fixes this issue and introduces a test case for it.
