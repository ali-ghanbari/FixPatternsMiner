Improve error logging when sending HTTP error response.

Ensure that we include the underlying exception as a root cause so
that our server-side logging includes it. Without this fix we just get
a WebApplicationException and its stacktrace with a null message, the
original exception was being returned to the client but thrown away on
the server side.
