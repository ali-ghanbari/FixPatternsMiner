NEXUS-5654 fixed race between offer/revoke and initializePrefixFile

The race was only possible if a new repository was provisioned and
deploys to the new repository happened very close in time. Extremely
unlikely unless repository provisioning and deployment are executed
by the same script.

The fix is to remove redundant 'unpublish' call during
initializePrefixFile.
