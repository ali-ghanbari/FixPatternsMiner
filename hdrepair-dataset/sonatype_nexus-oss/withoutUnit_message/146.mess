NEXUS-4492: Not fixing it, just making sure the repository does not have any "leftovers" from previous ITs. Too many moving parts to fix this without loosing any more time on it. Now, at least we are sure that Nexus1581 operates on it's own copy of repository. Will do it for now, will need to fix later.
