+If you'd like to help developing Syncany, there are a few ways to do so.

+1. **TODO markers**: The Java code contains lots of `TODO` markers, classified in *high*,
+   *medium* and *low*. Using the *Tasks* tab in Eclipse, pick one or two and start coding. To get
+   started, check out the *Setup Eclipse* section above.
+
+2. **Issues, features and tasks**: Besides the markers in the code, there are lots of other things 
+   that need doing. There is an always up-to-date list in the 
+   [issue tracker](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/issues) with the label
+   [status:help-needed](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/issues?labels=status%3Ahelp-needed).

-Syncany To-Do List
-=====================
-If you'd like to help developing Syncany, there are a few ways to do so.
-
-1. **TODO markers in the Java code**: 
-The code contains lots of *TODO* markers, classified in *high*, *medium* and *low*. Using
-the *Tasks* tab in Eclipse, pick one or two and start coding. To get started, check out
-the [README](README.md) file. 
-
-2. **Major To-Dos**: 
-Besides the TODO markers, there are lots of major things that need doing. There is an always 
-up-to-date list in the issue tracker with the tag [looking-for-help](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/issues?labels=looking-for-help). 
-We'll eventually get around to implementing all that, but for now we want to concentrate on making a stable
-core. If you have questions, feel free to ask.
