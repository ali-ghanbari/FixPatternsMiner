GAE related fixes: another GAE app, new license, javadoc mistake fix(#18168)

Google forces applications owners to migrate all applications to 
a new [High Replication] DataStorage. An old Vaadin application is deleted, 
and a new one is created because of that migration.

GAE license is replaced with latest one.
