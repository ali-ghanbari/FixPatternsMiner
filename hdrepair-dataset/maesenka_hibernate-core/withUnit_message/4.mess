JBPAPP-7491 , JBPAPP-7488 , HHH-6806 Add support for vfsfile and vfszip in JarVisitor

The method getVisitor(URL jarUrl, Filter[] filters, String entry) does not have conditionals for protocols vfs based,
like vfszip or vfsfile. It returns an InputStreamZippedJarVisitor implementation for both protocols. If it is a vfszip,
it will work, but will not not for vfsfile. The fix includes vfszip and vfsfile to JarVisitorFactory, so it can return
FileZippedJarVisitor (more efficient than InputStreamZippedJarVisitor) for vfszip and ExplodedJarVisitor for vfsfile
