fixed: when a QBean throwed an exception at configuration time (i.e. after creation and registration in MBean server)
it never couldn be loaded again.
it was happening because qentry was never assigned the name, and the object was never unregistered from bean server.
So the next time it is deployed it could not be registered.

Now before registering the MBean if a prevous instance is found withat name it is unregistered
