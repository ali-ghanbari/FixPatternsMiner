fix ksdevice cmd line argument for static intf. provisioning

This fix changes the ksdevice=... cmd line argument behavior so that:
1. we add ksdevice=eth0 when dhcp from eth0 was chosen
2. we add ksdevice=eth0 when static provisioning from eth0 was chosen
3. we add ksdevice=link when we chose dhcp from first available interface
