fix generating pre-equires (pre="1" in metadata)

RPMSENSE_PREREQ (1 << 6) maps to pre="1", however there are more flags that
should map. libsolv has always considered also RPMSENSE_SCRIPT_PRE (1 << 9)
and RPMSENSE_SCRIPT_POST (1 << 10).

Prerequires that appeared in SLE-11 as (1 << 6) appear now in SLE-12 as
RPMSENSE_RPMLIB (1 << 24).
