Downgrade from WARN to DEBUG message about capped collection existing

Sample warning being changed to debug level:

  WARN org.mongodb.morphia.DatastoreImpl: DBCollection already exists is
    capped already; doing nothing.

This should not be a warning as there is no problem.  The DBCollection
will already exist on every application startup except the first one.
Also fixes grammar of the log message.

Fixes Morphia issue [#694](https://github.com/mongodb/morphia/issues/694)
