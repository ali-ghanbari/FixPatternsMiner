Add the SystemPrivilegesPermissionTest to junit._Suite to gain coverage of the SystemPermission class.
Minor refactor of the class to have seperate fixtures for the various tests, it was really already coded that way but the sub-methods were
run as a single fixture.
Commented out code related to DatabasePermission for two reasons:
 1) DERBY-3531 DatabasePermission uses methods not in J2ME/CDC/Foundation
 2) Since DatabasePermission is not used it would fail with the jar tests since it is correctly not included in any jar file.
