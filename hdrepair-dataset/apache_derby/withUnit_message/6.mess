DERBY-532: Support deferrable constraints

Patch derby-532-testAlterConstraintInvalidation.

Adds a fixture to test that prepared statement is invalidated when a
table its depends on undergoes an ALTER TABLE ALTER CONSTRAINT
statement. As it turns out, this is already handled by the common
machinery for ALTER TABLE.
