Reverting change 990841 from trunk which had gone for DERBY-3644 (NetworkServerControl.ping() on trunk against 10.3.2.1 and older servers give 'DRDA_InvalidReplyHeader2.S:Invalid reply header from network server: Invalid string . Plaintext connection attempt to an SSL enabled server?'). The change is incomplete and will cause problems if it ever got backported by itself. I will checkin a complete fix soon which will address DERBY-3644 and DERBY-4786
