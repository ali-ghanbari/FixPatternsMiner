DERBY-4442: Default value and identity in an INSERT result set evaluated too early

Back out the fix for DERBY-4419 and DERBY-4425, since the fix is no
longer necessary after the changes that added a ProjectRestrictNode on
top of the original insert source. The test cases for those bugs are
still part of the regression test suite.
