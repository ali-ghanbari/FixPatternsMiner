Fix wobbly spinners

Some progress bars use AnimatedRotateDrawable, which suffered
from the same bug as AnimationDrawable (until a recent fix). The
code would not account for the left/top offset of the drawable in its view,
so it would rotate the drawable around the wrong center, causing it to
wobble and not get erased properly.
