Fix the misconstruction of the Quartz cron expression from the Silverpeas one. In Silverpeas, the cron expression begins with the minute field whereas the Quartz one begins with the second field! The second field was not correctly filled for the Quartz scheduler. This bug is now fixed and an additional test is added to check that a job is well fired only once at the triggering time.
