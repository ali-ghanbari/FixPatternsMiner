Set WINDOW_CLOSE_TIMEOUT to 500 ms

It turned out that 100 was not enough on the spartan slaves. And we
did use 500 ms before, but for some reason it was changed back from
500 to 100 in ec84ae7f. The review for OPDRV-195 that the merge was
supposed to fix did not contain 500 so it was not seen there. Seems
like a mistake during the merge.

On the slaves we saw times of more than 200 ms for linux desktop.
