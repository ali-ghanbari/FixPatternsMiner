GUVNOR-510/BRMS-311. This is a bug in gwtext 2.0.5 or extjs 2.0.2. Upgraded to gwtext 2.0.6 does not help. This fix indeed fixed the problem, the missing row can be displayed now. Though it has a side effect: it has some resizing problems, i.e., sometimes you have to resize the editor to get the last row properly displayed.
