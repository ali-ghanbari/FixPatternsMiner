SONAR-6590 fix QueueItem status not saved after processing

because the container was not started, when cleanup method was invoked an IllegalStateException was raised by Pico because the current status of the container was CONSTRUCTED
unfortunately, the method to update the item status is after the call to the cleanup method and therefor was never invoked
