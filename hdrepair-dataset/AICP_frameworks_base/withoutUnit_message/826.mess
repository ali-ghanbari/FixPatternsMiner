Revert change to correct animations.

Incorrect animation was introduced with CL 196207 (perhaps in
combination with a later CL). Reverting part of that CL fixes
the incorrect animation and so far has not reintroduced the jank
that was fixed by that CL. If the jank reappears it should be
fixed in a different fashion than in CL 196207.

Fixes bug 6597505.
