Fix for bug 8578258: GridLayout is forcing wrong width to TextView widgets

GridLayout is working as intended here. The bug is appears to be in RelativeLayout
(and possibly LinearLayout).

The value of RelativeLayout.DEFAULT_WIDTH = Integer.MAX_VALUE/2 is 0x3FFFFFFF has bits
set in the range that is used to flag certain conditions and states by the layout system.

In View we have:

MEASURED_SIZE_MASK = 0x00ffffff
MEASURED_STATE_MASK = 0xff000000;
MEASURED_STATE_TOO_SMALL = 0x01000000

This change fixes this bug, though it looks as if that a safer solution would be to not introduce
this constant and code path in the first place - as RelativeLayout's measurement algorithm operates
in the LTR case without it.
