Don't set mHomeConsumed to true for KEY_ACTION_SLEEP

When the device goes to sleep it does not receive the key up event
which would normally set mHomeConsumed to false.  This behavior
causes the next double tap action to be missed.  Not setting
mHomeConsumed to true for KEY_ACTION_SLEEP fixes this issue.
