Fix unit tests failing due to "Should not be called before start() or
after stop()"

For example XMLTransformerTest.testImportIntroduction() would fail with:
	java.lang.AssertionError: Should not be called before start() or
    after stop() as mJob won't execute then
		at plugins.WebOfTrust.IdentityFetcher
       .scheduleCommandProcessing(IdentityFetcher.java:417)

The fix is to start() the IdentityFetcher in those unit tests as well.
We didn't start it previously since that would cause its thread to
iterate.
But it has been changed recently to not do so in unit tests: If
PluginRespirator is null (which it will be in those tests),
IdentityFetcher.start() will create a fake Runable which does nothing.
