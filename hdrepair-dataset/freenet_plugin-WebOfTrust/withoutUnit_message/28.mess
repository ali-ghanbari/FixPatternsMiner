SubscriptionManager.Subscription: Fix incomplete thread safety JavaDoc

- We modify the database so we must lock upon the transaction
- Also, talk about thread "safety", not "synchronization":
With regards to SubscriptionManager, synchronization is a technical term
which has a different meaning than thread sync so we should use a
different word here. The following commit will fix that for the rest of
the whole class SubscriptionManager.
