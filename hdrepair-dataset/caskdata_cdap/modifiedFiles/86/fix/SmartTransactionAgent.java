/**
 * This transaction agent defers all operations as long as possible while
 * preserving transactional semantics:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>write operations are deferred until a read operation is executed.</li>
 *   <li>when a read operation is received, it must return a value and thus
 *     execute immediately. Because it may depend on the writes that were already
 *     submitted, all deferred write operations are executed before the read.</li>
 *   <li>An increment counts as a read because it returns a result.</li>
 *   <li>The start of the transaction is deferred until the first operation is
 *     actually executed.</li>
 *   <li>Upon finish, all outstanding operations are executed, and the transaction
 *     is committed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This agent aborts the current transaction whenever an operation fails - even if
 * it is a read operation. After a failure, no more operations may be submitted.
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe - any synchronization is up to the caller.
 *
