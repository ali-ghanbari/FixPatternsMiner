Make the cache of serializers global.

If candlepin needs to create serializers with every call, then we loose alot of performance due to reflection being used to create the new serilaizer. I believe we fixed this as one point, but now the code is creating a new provider with each call which defeated the old caching model. Making the cache a singleton.
