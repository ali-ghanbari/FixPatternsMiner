ISPN-4484 fix caused unnecessary InterruptedExceptions

When state transfer is over, the response to the last StateResponseCommand
could reach the provider node after the CH_UPDATE from the coordinator.

If that happens, no data is lost, but the OutboundTransferTask thread is
interrupted and it logs the InterruptedException stack trace.
