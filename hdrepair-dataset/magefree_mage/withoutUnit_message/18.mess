* ReturnFromGraveyardToBattlefieldTargetEffect fixed that the target creature came back always under the owner control instead of under control of the controller of the effect (fixed cards: Fated Return, Rise from the Grave, Nighteyes The Desecrator, Debtors' Knell, Grim Return, Ashen Powder, Beacon of Unrest, Reanimate).
