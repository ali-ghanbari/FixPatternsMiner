Column and table names in Postgres are apparently case-sensitive.

ActiveObjects does not attempt to Uppercase columns in query strings, but
will respect uppercasing and properly send it to PG _if_ there is a space before
and after the = in the query. (oy.)

This fixed the only immediately fatal query I saw: I haven't gone through the rest.
