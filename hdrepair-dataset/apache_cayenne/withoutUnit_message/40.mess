Marcin Skladaniec contributed this fix. His problems with errors not being propagated properly from server to client were largely because of this missing flush().

Without it, the original cause message was being lost. We might still need to consider a switch to turn this off/on in the client for security reasons, but for now this reinstate the original purpose of the code.
