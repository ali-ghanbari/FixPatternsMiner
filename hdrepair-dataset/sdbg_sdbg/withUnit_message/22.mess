Bug fix with undefined members not showing up.
I believe that this fixes the bug that you were seeing Phil.  When I went to write a regression test against it, I couldn't reproduce it in a test- the test changes are just renames for consistency.
Phil- let me know if you are still seeing the behaviour.
