BUG-2637: migrate features

 - remove migrated features
 - integration test fix:
   - commented out dependencies to models affected by migration
   - adapted sal-binding-it in order not to push those models
     into pax-exam context
   - adapted sal-binding-broker-impl to use those models only in
     test scope
 - cleaned commented code/config
