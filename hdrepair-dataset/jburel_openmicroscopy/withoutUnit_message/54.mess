fix #2250 - added `Ice.Defaults.PreferSecure` and documented `Ice.Override.Secure`

The addition of `PreferSecure` changes little since `EndpointSelection` is
already specified. If, however, a site adminitrator configures tcp before
ssl for Glacier, the latter will be preferred.

`Override.Secure` would prevent the use of `createClient(false)` for now.
