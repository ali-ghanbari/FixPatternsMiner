The function getAbsolutePath(String) computed the path incorrectly for URL's 
where the hostname was in the directory name 

for e.g. the path for following url was computed incorrectly as 
gsiftp://osg-nemo-ce.phys.uwm.edu/opt/osg/data/LIGO/tmp/osg-nemo-ce.phys.uwm.edu/LIGO_UWM_NEMO/ligo-lalapps_tmpltbank-1.0

/Ligo_UWM_NEMO/ligo-lalapps_tmpltbank-1.0

instead of  /opt/osg/data/LIGO/tmp/osg-nemo-ce.phys.uwm.edu/LIGO_UWM_NEMO/ligo-lalapps_tmpltbank-1.0

This is now fixed.
