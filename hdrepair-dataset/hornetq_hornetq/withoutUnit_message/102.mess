fixed JMS & JORAM tests

* when JBoss Messaging is starting a JMS server, the JMSServerManager is in charge of starting/stopping the core MessagingServer
* in JMS test, fixed the beans config by ignoring start/stop on the MessagingServer bean
* in JORAM test, commented server.start() (will be started by the JMSServerManager)
