PROTON-834: further UTF-8 encoder fixes

After commit c65e897 it turned out there were still some issues with
strings containing a codepoint >0xDBFF which was being incorrectly
treated as a surrogate pair in the calculateUTF8Length method.

Fixed this up and added some more test coverage.

Closes #13
