fixing calculateAggregatesForOneScheduleWhenDBIsEmpty test

calculateAggregatesForOneScheduleWhenDBIsEmpty was using timestamps based off
of the current time which could lead to inconsistent results when executing
around boundary times for the 6 hour bucket. The test has been refactored to
use timestamps based off of set hours. The metric data that is inserted during
the test always has timestamps in the fifth hour (of the day).
