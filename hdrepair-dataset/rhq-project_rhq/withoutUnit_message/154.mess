fix todos in ResourceFacets

* although this object is not technically immutable anymore via private final
  member variables, it is still effectively immutable because there is no way
  to modify the member variables after object construction.  furthermore, this
  class is accessed through the ResourceFacetsCache, which guarantees correct
  multi-threaded access.
