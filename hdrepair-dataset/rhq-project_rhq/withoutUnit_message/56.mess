Bug 951738 - [hotfix] Use Commons HttpClient in ASConnection instead of JDK's HttpUrlConnection

Keepalive timeout paramater was too high. The server could close connection server-side and the agent would still try to reuse it.

Used the value HttpUrlConnection uses to expire connections (5 seconds if the server does not send its keepalive timeout in reponse headers).
