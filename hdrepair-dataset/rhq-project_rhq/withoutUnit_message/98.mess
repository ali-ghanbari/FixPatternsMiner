[BZ 720826] fix bug introduced in Table.refresh() by a recent commit of mine - do not assume this.listGrid is non-null in fetchData() callback, since if the user went off to another view before the fetch completed, the Table widget could have been destroyed by our Selenium locator infrastructure and this.listGrid could have been nulled out
