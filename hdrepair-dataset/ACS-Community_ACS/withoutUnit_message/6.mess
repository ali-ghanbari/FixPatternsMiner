Fixed a copy-and-paste error that resulted in a Member with a null value inside. 
This is expected to fix a JDK 7 test failure (ICT-1187), because this null value was used as key in a TreeMap in Error#putMember. The JDK 7 compatibility list states that such a null now yields an NPE whereas before it was erroneously ignored.
