Made gradle master build with 1.10-rc-1. Enjoy the progress bar and --tests

One 'controversial' change might be renaming configuration 'plugins' -> 'gradlePlugins'. It's a quick fix for an issue discovered in 1.10-rc-1 and it has a hidden benefit: longer is easier to search in large codebase.

Haven't ran complete build locally due to amount of time and resources it needs. I'll monitor the CIs.
