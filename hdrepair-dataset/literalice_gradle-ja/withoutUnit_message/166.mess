org.gradle.jvmargs now supports no-arg system properties, e.g. '-Dfoo'. Also, fixed the JvmOptions so that it never creates system properties with null value. All because you cannot have a system property with a null value: if you try to configure sys prop. with null it will fail with NPE, if you start program with -Dfoo, the value is an empty String.
