dereference raw bytes for deser of CMSUpperBound

This halves the memory usage for the query system, and most importantly,
brings it into line with what the query system is expecting it to be
about the size of. It is possible that the "sketch" field should be set
to null during "preEncode" but the query system doesn't do that, and it
is less likely to matter. Therefore it is kept aside here.
