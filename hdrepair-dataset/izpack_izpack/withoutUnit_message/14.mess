IZPACK-1182: continue evaluation of dynamic variables, until a stable
state is reached. This is important for dynamic variables, which depend
on other dynamic variables.
A dynamic variable with checkonce="true" can be updated several times
during ONE SINGLE call of DefaultVariables.refresh() and should be fixed
("checked") at the end of this refresh(), not during the refresh().
