imglib2-algorithms-gpl: work around another javac bug

The first argument to the FFTConvolution constructor
has to be casted to (RandomAccessibleInterval< R >)(Object),
whereas the second argument, which is of the same type,
doesn't have to be.

That is non-sensical and clearly a javac bug.

This error fixed actually by Stephan Preibisch.
