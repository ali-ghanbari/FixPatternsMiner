Fixed bug where inner enum types inside other enum types were not named correctly. They should have the "Enum" suffix just like the outer enum, e.g. FooEnum_InnerEnum. Previously they did not; this was to support anonymous inner value classes in enum types, e.g. FooEnum_$1. The solution is to only strip the "Enum" suffix from the inner type if it is anonymous.
