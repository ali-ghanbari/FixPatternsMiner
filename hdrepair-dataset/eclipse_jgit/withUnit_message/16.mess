Don't return success on failing paths in ResolveMerger

ResolveMerger#mergeImpl() was only returning false (= failed) when there
were unmerged paths. In the case when there were only failing paths, it
returned true.

Because MergeCommand looks at the return value for determining if the
merge failed, it would fall into the successful case there, where it
should instead return a MergeResult with MergeStatus.FAILED.

This change adds a test case for this and makes the ResolveMerger return
false when there are failing paths.

This was discovered while working on fixing bug 354099 and is needed for
its test case.
