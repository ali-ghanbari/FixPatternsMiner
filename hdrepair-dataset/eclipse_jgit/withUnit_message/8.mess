Fix GarbageCollection not to pack HEAD

When working on a non-bare repository with a detached HEAD jgit's GC was
packing the ref named "HEAD" into the packed-refs file and deleted the
loose ref (the file .git/HEAD!). This made the repo unusable for native
git. This is fixed by telling jgit to only pack refs starting from
"refs/"
