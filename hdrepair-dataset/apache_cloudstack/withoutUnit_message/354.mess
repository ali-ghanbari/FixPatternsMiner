bug 11463: userVms and routers being stopped by the simulator
status 11463: resolved fixed
reviewed-by: Kishan.Kavala@citrix.com

When the management server restarts and does a full vmSync we need to send back
the state of the simulator VMs in the StartCommand for management server to
restore the states. Or HA will mark them as stopped.
