The ExtProd interface was not added to the result environment interfaces list when created, this is fixed. The bug with the double generated constructor, was because the extension declared a field with the same name and type as the Base, but with a different fieldtype (graph or tree). The ClassFactory generates as standard three constructor, one default, another constructor with all the fields and one with only the tree fields. If the extension has a field with the same name and type but different fieldtype, the last two mentioned generated constructors could be identical
