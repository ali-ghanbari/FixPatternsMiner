Sequence: fix subquery ordering bug

And add test that triggers it.

Basically, when instantiating a Sequence operator, all the sub-plans
should be inserted at the *head* of the planQ -- they're supposed to
execute immediately. We were instantiating them at the tail, but the
tests were not comprehensive enough to catch this. The new test does.
