+      // TODO: there is a potential bug here.  So far, the assumption
+      // is that all unary transitions which occur at the root only
+      // ever occur at the root.  If that assumption doesn't hold for
+      // some treebank, it may occur that a root transition occurs in
+      // the middle of the tree but is marked "isRoot", meaning it can
+      // never actually be used in the middle of the tree.
+      //
+      // A solution to this would be to keep a separate index of all
+      // the transitions which have only ever been seen in the context
+      // of the root.  Eg, nothing comes after those transitions
+      // except Finalize or Idle.  (That also picks up the unlikely
+      // case of a binary transition being a root transition.)
