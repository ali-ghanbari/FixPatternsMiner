Minor fix to a comment from previous DS-896 commit.  Accidentally committed a comment that referred to code that is not yet completed (i.e. comment referring to ability to run site-wide Tasks from Admin UI).  Removing that comment, until that future Site-wide code is completed/approved in a future JIRA ticket.
