Bug fix. It would be nice if we could extract ROD annotations for the whole length of an extended event (indel), and we tried... But alas, it does not work with the current ROD system (after extracting length on ref > 1 ROD data for a deletion, rod iterator crashes on the attempt to re-load annotations for next reference base)
