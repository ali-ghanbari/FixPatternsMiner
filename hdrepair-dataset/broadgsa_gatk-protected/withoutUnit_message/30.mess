Fixing the Haplotype Resolver so that it doesn't complain about missing header lines.

The code comments very clearly state that INFO fields shouldn't be propagated into the output,
but someone must have accidentally changed it afterwards.  This is just a simple one-line fix
to make sure the code adhered to the comments.

Delivers #63333488.
