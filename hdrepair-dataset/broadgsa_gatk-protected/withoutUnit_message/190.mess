Disable optimization that increases marginal speed of the GATK slightly but
can produce data loss in a narrow corner case where the BGZF block(s) locations
and offsets in the last index bucket of contig n overlap exactly with the BGZF
block locations and offset in the last index bucket of contig n+1.

A proper fix that keeps the optimization has already been introduced into
unstable, but disabling the optimization is a low risk way to make sure that
users of stable experience no data loss.
