Fix #192: AbstractTripleSort has memory leak.

AbstractTriplesSort registers with the JVM to be informed when
the available memory gets full. However, it never unregistered
from the JVM so that the JVM kept referring the instances
effectively producing a memory leak.

This commit fixes this leak by unregistering the module from
the JVM when calling closeStream().
