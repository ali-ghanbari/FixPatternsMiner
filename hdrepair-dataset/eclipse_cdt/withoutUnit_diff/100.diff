- * Note that for the moment, this class is inheriting from AbstractDsfService,
- * although it does not register as a service.  This class is only used by the Expression
- * Service, and therefore, need not be a service of its own.
- * However, to be able to implement ICommandControl, we automatically must implement
- * IDsfService, so, that is why we extend AbstractDsfService.  We must implement
- * ICommandControl service, to be able to interface properly with the MICommandCache which
- * is using this class.
