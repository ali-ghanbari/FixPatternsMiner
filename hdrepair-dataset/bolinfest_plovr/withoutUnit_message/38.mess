Changed the default value of the output-charset option to "US-ASCII" even though it was previously "UTF-8". Making "UTF-8" the default will cause a problem for users that do not fix their webserver to serve their JS using the matching Content-Type, which is unfair to expect from novice users. Making "US-ASCII" the default should cause fewer problems for novices.
