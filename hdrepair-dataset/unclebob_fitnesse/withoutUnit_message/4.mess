Allow Scenarios with parameterized style but with empty paramter names

This fixes a bug whith parameterized style scenarios where the paramters
have no name like:

|scenario | Division _ _ _ | numerator, denominator, quotient|

Previously this only woked with two spaces between each underscore. The
regex pattern has been fixed to work now with only one space.
