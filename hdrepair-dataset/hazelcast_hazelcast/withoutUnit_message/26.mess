I/O scheduling bug fixed.

The problem happens when a packet doesn't fit into the outputBuffer and
there are no other pending packets in the queue. When both packets queues
are empty, we are removing write interest immediately, ignoring partially
written packet. And that packet's remaining part is written only when another
packet is enqueued and write interest is set.

This is specially visible in queries - a packet with QueryResult can easily
exceed a size of the outputBuffer.
