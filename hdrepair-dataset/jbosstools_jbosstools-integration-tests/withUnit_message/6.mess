Another fix for mac: Add java 1.8 to condition + direct call to MacSpecifics.

This should finally make the dummy test work on all macs again.
First, it adds a new condition so that the awt.toolkit property
is set correctly for both java 1.7 and 1.8 on mac.
Also, this commit adds a direct call to MacSpecifics from within
the dummy test (which does not use RequirementAwareSuite).
