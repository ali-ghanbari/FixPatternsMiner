Merge remote-tracking branch 'toad/fix-big-containers-losing-files' into next

When large files are moved to external containers, /path/to/filename redirects
to [external container]/filename.

Before this fix, this caused "Not in archive" errors because the file was
stored as [external container]/path/to/filename.
