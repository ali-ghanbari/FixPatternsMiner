Revert "Usability fix: The "Add a friend" page did not select any of the trust values by default. This would result in an "Internal error" being shown if the user added a friend without selecting a trust level. We select "NORMAL" by default now." - Revert this one too. We need the user to choose. They SHOULD get an error if they don't choose. Obviously the error should be a bit more descriptive - ideally we'd go back to the page with a big red error at the top, all the values filled in, so they can choose.

This reverts commit 99001a8479016fd0db3f3709b899fb206b3601e7.
