1026:
- fix more bucket errors:
-- don't schedule each check block twice (bug caused 33% performance loss and frequent failure of inserts since ~ 1021)
-- more double-closes in BucketTools (mostly non-fatal)
- fix race condition/sync issues resulting in NPE in NetworkInterface construction
- don't call SplitFileInserter.encodedSegment twice per segment
- comments, indents
