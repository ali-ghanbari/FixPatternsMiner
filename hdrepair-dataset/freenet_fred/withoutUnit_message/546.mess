1156:

You might need to reload your plugins when you update to this build

fproxy:
	- bug #2446: handle the "human" notation for the max-size parameter
	- bug #2446: fproxy should allow configurable max-size parameter
	- bug #2370: don't ask for the darknet port to be forwarded if there is no darknet peer
	- change the Opennet Question
	- hide the MeaningfullNodeNameUserAlert if there is no darknet peer
	- resolve bug #2499 (Reduce the number of steps of the wizard if possible)
	- combine the outgoing request distribution histograms into one.
	- skip the bandwidth limiting step in the wizard if the node has detected a recent enough, and working UPnP plugin
	- FOAF: make the peer selection stats time decaying

plugins:
	- return the request handle on non blocking calls
	- handle plugins which require newer jvms better
	- firstTimeWizard: switch steps to enums... so that we can extend it easily
	- enable sha1 check for downloaded official plugins

config:
	- show UserAlert for need node restart config change
	- allow changing storeType
	- add isReadOnly() for ConfigCallback

FNP:
	- reinstanciate the size-length check in FNPPacketMangler (MTU)
	- get rid of the old FNPLocationChange message now that 1154 is mandatory
	- fix bug #2492: set Socket.setReuseAddress(true);
	- disconnect from a seed client after an hour.

dev stuffs:
	- logging
	- use generics and autoboxing in some classes
	- replace freenet.support.Closer by java.io.Closeable
	- get rid of the old plugin system
	- code cleanup
	- convert AddressIdentifier.AddressType from a class to an enum
	- update SizeUtil ... We might need to get a value without any space
	- arrayBucket.size() is unreliable until the OutputStream has been closed... So close it first and ensure it's not closed more than once
	- throw if we attempt to write to a read-only ArrayBucket
	- simplify the client-layer and bucket cruft
	- fix Fields.valueOf() so that it deals with both the SI and ICE notation
	- fix RealNodeBusyNetworkTest so that it finishes
	- switch PluginManager to 1.5 code level
	- Bootstrap push/pull test; seednode tester; bootstrap test

performance:
	- spare a signature verification on each signature if we aren't debugging the node
	- reimplement LineReadingInputStream.readLine() so that it's faster
	- don't create new HTMLNodes when we draw the circles on the StatisticsToadlet
	- PeerNode.getNumberOfSelections() is definitly too time consuming: don't return a copy of the TreeSet (might lead to sync problems)
	- switch the l10n from StringBuffer to StringBuilder
	- switch the Toadlets from StringBuffer to StringBuilder
	- spare a call to Logger.shouldLog() on a hot spot
	- delete StringArray now that we use java 1.5
	- implement RAMBuckets and ensure all the TemporaryBuckets use them if possible
	- enable "group stripping" every time a compressed noderef is required.
	- DiffieHellman: tweak the generation settings
	- JFK: tweak the size of the signed-exponents cache
	- add two new config options to disable encryption on file buckets

l10n:
	- german language update by NEOatNHNG
	- french language update by batosai
