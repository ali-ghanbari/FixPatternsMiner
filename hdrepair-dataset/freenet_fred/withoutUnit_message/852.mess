1020 changelog:
- Request coalescing no longer causes one of the requests to fail, hang, leak a RequestHandler or otherwise break (hopefully, not fully tested)
- LOTS of improvements to the datastore code
-- Write store transactions to disk before returning from commit() (better data integrity, the D in ACID)
-- Don't use the Big Fat Lock while doing store operations and rely on BDB record locking.
-- Set the lock timeout to 1 minute. 500ms is not enough: we have lots of threads, disk I/O, all on commodity hardware.
-- Completely new logic for detecting pre-existing key and dealing with it in *put*()
-- Prevent timeout on startup while reconstructing or shrinking large stores
-- Online shrink the store if the shrink is less than 10%. New option node.storeForceBigShrinks option allows online shrinking the store for any shrink size. Online shrinking is not usually a good idea because it doesn't necessarily keep the most recently used data; only turn this on if you need to shrink quickly.
-- Refactoring: delete some dead code, simplify existing code, split stuff out etc, clearer code, more comments, minor optimisations/simplifications, better variable names, minor fixes etc
-- Handle corrupt pubkeys better
-- Do hole checking at the same time as offline shrink on startup
-- Prevent two simultaneous shrinks happening
-- Always chop off surplus store space which is only used by duplicate keys
-- Do online shrink on a thread, rather than waiting for it to complete when setting the config option. Continue until the store is within its current size limit, not until we don't delete any blocks.
-- Use Database.count() when we want the number of blocks in the store, countCHKBlocksFromDatabase() (now highestBlockNumberInDatabase()) when we want the highest block number.
- New revocation key (we lost the privkey for the old one
- Up freenet-ext requirement to 11
- Fix a bug causing Freenet to think there are far more nodes on the network than there actually are. Also only remember the last week's worth of swap locations.
- FCP: AllowUnreadableFiles in ClientPutDiskDir wasn't working.
- Tooltip showing default value for each config option in /config/
- Explain that Freenet cannot detect port forwards in the warning message.
- Hopefully fix ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when fetching splitfiles
- Give option to queue the request on all non-fatal fproxy errors
- POST support for plugins (necessary for freekiwiki), and an NPE fix in the plugin loading code
- Distinguish full-cone from directly-connected in warnings.
- Option.getDefault() returns a String like the other methods
- Exclude JSTUN plugin from build path as it is the only thing that requires java 1.5 support
- Trying to track down an impossible NPE
- Fail more gracefully (and log info on OOMs to wrapper.log) on an OOM or other unreasonable error in various places: compressing data to insert, sending an insert/request, running IP detection plugins, TMCI main loop, handling an FCP connection, serving FCP connections, loading plugins
- Various minor refactorings
- Minor bugfix constructing the error message for the user but not returning it in *Filter
- Logging, comments etc
- Note that we now have assertions in various places; it is recommended to run with assertions enabled for freenet classes (wrapper.java.additional.3=-enableassertions:freenet) at least if you are a dev.

Related:
- Updates to JSTUN plugin (try more times, some outcomes are inherently unlikely to be true so confirm it)
- Updates to MDNSDiscovery plugin
- Updates to Librarian plugin (cosmetic and url update)
