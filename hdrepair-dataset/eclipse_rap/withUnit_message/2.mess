Fix Text widget input element position

With quirksmode disabled, all the previous workarounds seem to cause
issues instead of fixing them. In non-IE browser, the text seems to be
vertically shifted 1 px too far. With the workarounds removed it looks
fine in all browser.

Fix for Bug 467526 - Widget text not centered vertically anymore
